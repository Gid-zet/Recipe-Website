            <h1 class="txt">Our food philosophy</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Proper storage of food products is crucial to maintain its nutritional value, taste, prevent spoilage and contamination, and extend its shelf life.  We take the following actions to preserve our products in the warehouse properly. <br>    
            Temperature control: We store our products in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area to prevent spoilage. The ideal temperature is between 50°F and 70°F. Extreme temperatures, such as freezing or heat, can damage the product and affect its quality. <br>
            Moisture control: We store our products in a dry environment with low humidity levels. Example, moisture can cause the rice to become moldy, rancid, or attract pests. The recommended humidity level for rice storage is below 60%. <br>
            Separation of incompatible products:Our oil products are stored away from other incompatible products, such as chemicals or flammable materials, to prevent cross-contamination or fire hazards and we regularly inspect for any signs of leaks, spills, or damage to be removed and replaced immediately.

            <h1 class="txt">Let's talk about rice</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Rice is one of the most widely consumed foods in the world, and for good reasons, It is simple to cook, and delicious. There are three types of rice: short, medium, and long grain. Sushi is typically made with short-grain rice, which has a chewy feel. Long-grain rice is less soft and more likely to break apart than medium-grain varieties. Long-grain varieties of rice have a tendency to remain separate while cooking and come out fluffy. Each variety has unique qualities and complements a particular dish the best. Short-grain rice like supreme rice, starlight, and viva indian rice are similar in length and width and develops a sticky texture when cooked. Medium-grain rice expands to roughly twice its original size and becomes moist and soft when cooked. Jasmine and basmati rice are two to four times as long as they are wide, and when cooked, they develop a dryer, fluffier feel.</p>
