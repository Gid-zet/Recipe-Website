            <h1>Let's talk about rice</h1>
            <p>Rice is one of the most widely consumed foods in the world, and for good reasons, It is simple to cook, and delicious. Rice can do it all while offering comfort and satisfaction, whether it's used as a main dish ingredient, a side dish, a snack, or a dessert. Here, we examine the differences between ten varieties of rice and offer suggestions for how to best consume each one. But first, a word on grain length. There are three types of rice grains: short, medium, and long. Each variety has unique qualities and complements a particular dish the best. Short-grain rice like supreme rice, starlight, and viva indian rice are similar in length and width and develops a sticky texture when cooked. When cooked, medium-grain rice expands to roughly twice its original size and becomes moist and soft. Jasmine and basmati rice are two to four times as long as they are wide, and when cooked, they develop a dryer, fluffier feel.</p>
